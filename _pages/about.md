Welcome to My Homepage!  

I am Md Abdullah Al Forhad, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of North Texas](https://engineering.unt.edu/cse/index.html). My research focuses on **Deep Active Learning** and **Continual Learning**, with a passion for enhancing AI's adaptability and performance.

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of North Texas and a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from East West University, Dhaka. With a deep commitment to innovation and collaboration, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the field of Artificial Intelligence.

I am currently working under the guidance of [Dr. Weishi Shi](https://engineering.unt.edu/people/weishi-shi.html), whose mentorship has been pivotal in my academic journey.

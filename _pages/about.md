Welcome to My Homepage!  

I am Md Abdullah Al Forhad, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of North Texas](https://engineering.unt.edu/cse/index.html). I conduct research in the [Learning · Language · Vision (LLaVi) Lab](https://llavi-lab.github.io/) under the supervision of [Dr. Weishi Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nAPZIPsAAAAJ). 

My research focuses on **Deep Active Learning**, **Continual Lifelong Learning**, and **Multi-modal Learning** with a passion for enhancing AI's adaptability and performance.

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the [University of North Texas](https://engineering.unt.edu/cse/index.html) and a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from [East West University](https://www.ewubd.edu/), Dhaka. With a deep commitment to innovation and collaboration, I aim to contribute meaningfully to Artificial Intelligence.

### Welcome to My Homepage!  

I am Md Abdullah Al Forhad, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of North Texas](https://engineering.unt.edu/cse/index.html), with a strong passion for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My research focuses on Deep Active Learning and Continual Learning, aimed at enhancing AI's adaptability and performance.  

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of North Texas](https://engineering.unt.edu/cse/index.html) and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [East West University](https://www.ewubd.edu/), Dhaka. Driven by curiosity and a commitment to innovation, I am always seeking opportunities to collaborate and contribute meaningfully to the field of Artificial Intelligence and beyond.  

I have authored five publications, including journal articles, conference papers, and book chapters, reflecting my dedication to advancing knowledge in the field. My goal is to make significant contributions to Computer Science through impactful research and effective teaching. I am currently under the supervision of [Dr. Weishi Shi](https://engineering.unt.edu/people/weishi-shi.html), whose guidance has been instrumental in my academic journey.  

### Research Interests in AI:  
- **Active Learning**  
- **Continual Learning**  

Let's collaborate and innovate together to shape the future of AI!
